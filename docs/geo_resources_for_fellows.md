# Looking to Build the Technical Capacity of Your Participants? Start Here!


## Programming and Platforms

##### Key:
* **Fast:** A general quickguide or easy-to-speed-through tutorial.
* **Medium:** A slower walkthrough tutorial that you can pause, rewind, and do in your own time.
* **Slow:** A tutorial with a more structured format, usually accompanied with extensive exercises.

### ArcGIS
ArcGIS has a "choose your own adventure" type of learning hub that your participants can tailor to their level of experience or specific needs: [Learn ArcGIS](https://learn-arcgis-learngis.hub.arcgis.com/)

### Google Earth Engine
* **Fast:** [Get Started with Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted) or the [Beginner's Cookbook](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/beginners-cookbook)
* **Medium:** [Google Earth Engine for Dummies](http://slides.com/miguelangelmenarguez/)
* **Slow:** [Google Earth Engine Tutorials with Labs](https://americaview.org/program-areas/education/google-earth-engine-tutorials/)

### Python
* **Fast:** [Learn Python in 10 Minutes](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/)
* **Medium:** [Learn Python for Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYTs9HwFGbY)
* **Slow:** [Esri Python for Everyone](https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/57630436851d31e02a43f13c/python-for-everyone/) or [Basics of Python and arcpy, the Python Library of ESRI ArcGIS](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-arcpy1/) (should have free access for DEVELOPers.)

### R and RStudio
* **Fast:** [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/r-tutorial/index.html)
* **Medium:** [R Tutorials for Non-Programmer Data Scientists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCjns0EpAo8&list=PLFAYD0dt5xCzTQHDhMPZwBoaAXWeVhZzg) -- you can select from 37 different mini-lessons by topic!
* **Slow:** [R Basics](https://www.udemy.com/course/r-basics/)

### R vs. Python
If it is unclear which programming language is best suited for your upcoming project, check out this (nerdy) debate: [R vs. Python for Data Science: Summary of Modern Advances](https://elitedatascience.com/r-vs-python-for-data-science)

## Other Suggestions

### Remote Sensing
Encourage your participants to sign up for [upcoming ARSET webinars](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/webinars) or to review [past training sessions](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/users/NASA%20Applied%20Remote%20Sensing%20Training%20%28ARSET%29%20Online%20Capacity%20Building%20Resources.pdf), which have introductory and advanced trainings in Land Applications, Health & Air Quality, Water Resource Management, and Disaster Management.

### DEVELOP Events
Make sure that your participants mark Software Carpentry and the GEE seminars on their calendars and **actively** participate in these events! Even if they are familiar with a particular language or platform, they can always learn something new.

##### These are just some starting suggestions that you can supply to your team to help them navigate the software development process. 

You can find more recommendations on the **Data & Tools** or **Training Resources** pages on DEVELOPedia.

If you have any methods you've found to be particularly successful for building technological capacity, we'd love for you to share!
